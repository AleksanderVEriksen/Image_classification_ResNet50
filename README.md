# Classification of concrete cracks using the pre-trained ResNet50
Classification of concrete cracks is very important for monitoring health of buildings. Severe cracks might conclude in a building falling apart.
This projects involves classification of different images showing cracks or not. The images are divided into Negative and Positive. Negative represent no cracks, while Positive represent cracks.
